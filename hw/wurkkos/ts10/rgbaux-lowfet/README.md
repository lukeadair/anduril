# Wurkkos TS10 w/ RGB aux + reduced-power FET

Starting in mid-2024, some TS10 models were built with LEDs with lower Vf, and
they destroy themselves when operated at full power from the direct-drive FET.
This branch runs at half power instead, to avoid hardware damage.

Regardless, sustained turbo is not recommended on any TS10 models, because they
are overpowered for their size and LED type.
